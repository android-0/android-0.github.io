# Finished Computer Graphics from Scratch

Posted: Sun, 17-11-2024.

I followed Computer Graphics from Scratch book by Gabriel Gambetta.
Here is the [online version](https://gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/)
I port the provided demo code from javascript to c. This is by far my biggest c project.
See [here](https://codeberg.org/jonesangga/c-computer-graphics-from-scratch).

I don't use external libraries. The image result is in ppm format.
File ppm.h on the root is used for managing ppm image.
I open the image using feh:
```
feh --force-aliasing filename.ppm
```

Some chapters has more than one demo but here I combine them per chapter.
I should refactor them.

I found that I improved more by just searching and learning the particular thing I need
than reading the whole book.
