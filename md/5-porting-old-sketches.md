# Porting Old Sketches

Posted: Tue, 26-11-2024.

I used processing in 2022 and p5 in 2023.
Many of my sketches are just static designs.
Now I port that to vanila javascript with html canvas.
This is part of my new project Element of Creative Coding (EoCC) where I try
to categorize, implement, and document aspects and techniques in creative coding
as I am learning.
Here is the link: [eocc](https://jonesangga.codeberg.page/eocc).

I try to minimize dependecies.
Every sketch will have exactly two files: sketch-name.html and sketch-name.js.
There are no separate js files for helper functions. No CSS.
I want it to be easy to copy and run individual sketch on others machine.

This project has no rigid plan and no deadline. Any time I find something
intresting I try to build that and add to this collection with some explanations.
More about this project on future post.
