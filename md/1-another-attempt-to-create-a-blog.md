# Another Attempt to Create a Blog

Let's start with my list of failed blog/web projects:

- 2019: My first local landing page following Indian youtube tutorial.
- 2020: Tried a free hosting 000webhost, doing php and mysql.
- 2020: Tried some obscure free hostings.
- 2020: Bought a domain, only last 3 months.
- 2021: Github pages: math calculator/solver.
- 2021: Blogspot posting math and pascal programming.
- 2022: Jekyll.
- 2023: Github pages: showcase creative coding.
- 2024: Hugo.
- 2024: Cloudflare pages: math calculator/solver.
- 2024: neocities + my own static site generator + github action.

In this attempt, I made the following principles:

- No JS.
- No favicon.
- Minimal CSS, one for all.
- No id and class attributes.
- No menu bar.
- No comment section.
- No footer.
- Only float left.
- Use CDN for images.

Blog tree:
```
- index.html
- style.css
- posts/
    - post1.html
    - post2.html
    - ...
```

I will stick to this structure for every post:

- meta charset.
- meta viewport.
- link css.
- Link to home.
- title.
- h1 title.
- Author.
- Posted.
- Last edited.
- tldr.
- hr.
- Text post.

For my coping, I call this HTML meditation.
I write the layout once and never change it. So, in 10 years it will look nostalgic.
I am writing this on vim.
I decided to less worried about my English. I am bad at writing English.
I will mostly write bullet list because it is easier than paragraph.
